## Project task

This is a solution to the [Front end GitHub user search app](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6). This project displays the GitHub user based on the username client searched.

## Project overview

This is a simple project, and also one of my first in which I used third-party API. I used GitHub API for searching users based on the username client entered. I used the fetch method for getting data. I implemented a theme switcher as well. I used local storage for saving user's selected theme.
